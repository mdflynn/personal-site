  title: "Wells Fargo",
  description: `After I graduated UNC, I spent a few months selling Hyundais
  before I found my first career oriented job. I started off at
  Wells Fargo Financial. I spent a year commuting back and forth
  from Fort Collins, CO to Cheyenne, WY. During this role, I focused
  on generating appointments and leads in order to offer a customer
  a wide range of credit offerings. I received a District Employee
  of the Month award for the success I was having in the role. I
  transferred over to the banking side eventually, working my way up
  from a teller to a personal banker. I consistently met and
  surpassed rigorous sales goals while ensuring customer's were set
  up in the best available banking situation.`,

  description: `After I spent roughly three years working for Wells Fargo at
  varying locations, I decided that I wasn't happy where I was and
  how my career was shaping up. I didn't feel strongly about my job
  and that it would bring my the type of challenges I was looking
  for. I ended up quitting, cashing out my 401(k) plan and moving to
  Prague, Czech Republic to get certified in Teaching English as a
  Foreign Language (TEFL). Due to Eyjafjallaj√∂kull in Iceland
  erupting right when we were supposed to fly to Europe, this trip
  only lasted four months. I was able to earn my certification, do a
  bit of teaching, and explore central and eastern Europe. It was a
  life-changing experience`,

  description: `After I came back from Europe, I spent some time worker as a
  teller and snowboarding as much as possible living in Steamboat
  Springs, CO. I needed to kill some time before I went to my MBA
  program in the following summer. It was a season with heavy snow
  and great runs. It was an amazing experience, both on the mountain
  and in the community. During that time, I was able to campaign and
  win the title of Steamboat's Most Eligible Bachelor; my crowning
  achievement! I then spent the next two years living in Denver and
  attending the University of Colorado at Denver. I was to graduate
  with my MBA that focuses on International Business.`,

  decommissioning cellular site's 911 data and routing. Ensuring

  description: `I took an
  opportunity to utilize my Public Safety knowledge and joined
  Motorolla Solutions as a Senior Account Manager. It was a great
  position and opportunity. I was responsible for accounts in five
  states in the PNW region. I was on the road most days of the week
  meeting clients and discussing their needs. I was also attending
  trade shows and demonstrating our products. However, I quickly
  found out, that this wasn't the right fit for me. I did not enjoy
  the traveling lifestyle like I initially anticipated. There's
  something to be said for sleeping in your own bed! I decided to
  take a break from a career oriented job and drove for Uber and
  Lyft for about a year and a half. It was a little awkward at
  first, but I grew to love the freedom it afforded me and I was
  able to make ends meet!`,

  years. I tried random tutorials online but never really committed
  to it. But with Turing, I decided to fully commit to coding and
  the career change. I chose the Front-End Engineering program. This
  is a seven month, full-time coding bootcamp. On average, I'd spend
  65+ hours a week attending class, taking notes, practicing problem
  solving, and working on the constantly changing projects with
  evolving languages. It's been the hardest thing I've ever done but
  so far has been the most rewarding journey I've taken. I've met
  some great people in my cohort and have a positive and excited
  outlook for my future.`,
