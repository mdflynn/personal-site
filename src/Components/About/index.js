//Wells Fargo
//After I graduated UNC, I spent a few months selling Hyundais before I found my
//first career oriented job. I started off at Wells Fargo Financial. I spent a year commuting back and forth from 
//Fort Collins, CO to Cheyenne, WY. During this role, I focused on generating
//appointments and leads in order to offer a customer a wide range of credit offerings. I received a 
//District Employee of the Month award for the success I was having in the role. I transfered over to the banking
//side eventually, working my way up from a teller to a personal banker. I consistently met and surpassed 
//rigorous sales goals while ensuring customer's were set up in the best available banking situation.

//Prague
//After I spent roughly three years working for Wells Fargo at varying locations, I decided that I wasn't happy
//where I was and how my career was shaping up. I didn't feel strongly about my job and that it would
//bring my the type of challenges I was looking for. I ended up quitting, casing out my 401(k) plan and moving 
//Prague, Czech Republic to get certified in Teaching English as a Foregin Language (TEFL). Due to EyjafjallajÃ¶kull 
//in Iceland erupting right when we were supposed to fly to Europe, this trip only lasted four months. I was able
//to earn my certification, do a bit of teaching, and explore central and eastern Europe. It was a life-changing
//experience

//Steamboat -> MBA
//After I came back from Europe, I spent some time worker as a teller and snowboarding as much as possible living in 
//Steamboat Springs, CO. I needed to kill some time before I went to my MBA program in the following summer. It was 
//a season with heavy snow and great runs. It was an amazing experience, both on the mountain and in the community. 
//During that time, I was able to campaign and win the title of Steamboat's Most Eligible Bachelor; my crowning 
//achievement! I then spent the next two years living in Denver and attending the University of Colorado at Denver. 
//I was to graduate with my MBA that focuses on International Business. 

//Intrado
//After my MBA, I worked at Intrado for three years. A company that's in the public safety and telecommunication industry.
//I worked my way up to a Senior Implementation Specialist. I handle projects that ranged in size and focused on 
//implementing and decommissioning cellular site's 911 data and routing. Ensuring that 911 calls were properly routed to
//the nearest PSAP (Public Safety Answering Point).
