I didn't feel strongly about my job\n              and that it would bring my the type of challenges I was looking\n              for. I ended up quitting, casing out my 401(k) plan and moving\n              Prague, Czech Republic to get certified in Teaching English as a\n              Foreign Language (TEFL). Due to Eyjafjallajökull in Iceland\n              erupting right when we were supposed to fly to Europe, this trip\n              only lasted four months. I was able to earn my certification, do a\n              bit of teaching, and explore central and eastern Europe.

I needed to kill some time before I went to my MBA\n              program in the following summer. It was a season with heavy snow\n              and great runs. It was an amazing experience, both on the mountain\n              and in the community. During that time, I was able to campaign and\n              win the title of Steamboat's Most Eligible Bachelor; my crowning\n              achievement!

However, I\n              quickly found out, that this wasn't the right fit for me. I did\n              not enjoy the traveling lifestyle like I initially anticipated.\n              There's something to be said for sleeping in your own bed! I\n              decided to take a break from a career oriented job and drove for\n              Uber and Lyft for about a year and a half. It was a little awkward\n              at first, but I grew to love the freedom it afforded me and I was\n              able to make ends meet!\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </section>\n      <section className=\"about-odd\">\n        <div className=\"text-container\">\n          <img\n            className=\"about-img\"\n            src={careerChange}\n            alt=\"whats your next move\"\n          />\n          <div className=\"overlay\">\n            <div className=\"about-p\">\n              I ended up taking an assistant supervisor position in the treasury\n              management department at FirstBank.

I chose the Front-End Engineering program. This\n              is a seven month, full-time coding bootcamp.

I consistently met and surpassed\n// rigorous sales goals while ensuring customer's were set up in the best available banking situation.\n\n// Prague\n// After I spent roughly three years working for Wells Fargo at varying locations, I decided that I wasn't happy\n// where I was and how my career was shaping up. I didn't feel strongly about my job and that it would\n// bring my the type of challenges I was looking for. I ended up quitting, casing out my 401(k) plan and moving\n// Prague, Czech Republic to get certified in Teaching English as a Foreign Language (TEFL). Due to Eyjafjallajökull\n// in Iceland erupting right when we were supposed to fly to Europe, this trip only lasted four months. I was able\n// to earn my certification, do a bit of teaching, and explore central and eastern Europe. It was a life-changing\n// experience\n\n// Steamboat -> MBA\n// After I came back from Europe, I spent some time worker as a teller and snowboarding as much as possible living in\n// Steamboat Springs, CO. I needed to kill some time before I went to my MBA program in the following summer. It was\n// a season with heavy snow and great runs. It was an amazing experience, both on the mountain and in the community.\n// During that time, I was able to campaign and win the title of Steamboat's Most Eligible Bachelor; my crowning\n// achievement! I then spent the next two years living in Denver and attending the University of Colorado at Denver.\n// I was to graduate with my MBA that focuses on International Business.\n\n// Intrado\n// After my MBA, I worked at Intrado for three years. A company that's in the public safety and telecommunication industry.\n// I worked my way up to a Senior Implementation Specialist. I handle projects that ranged in size and focused on\n// implementing and decommissioning cellular site's 911 data and routing. Ensuring that 911 calls were properly routed to\n// the nearest PSAP (Public Safety Answering Point).\n\n// Motorolla and Uber\n// I took an opportunity to utilize my Public Safety knowledge and joined Motorolla Solutions as a Senior Account Manager.\n// It was a great position and opportunity. I was responsible for accounts in five states in the PNW region. I was on\n// the road most days of the week meeting clients and discussing their needs. I was also attending trade shows and\n// demonstrating our products. However, I quickly found out, that this wasn't the right fit for me. I did not enjoy the\n// traveling lifestyle like I initially anticipated. There's something to be said for sleeping in your own bed! I\n// decided to take a break from a career oriented job and drove for Uber and Lyft for about a year and a half. It was\n// a little awkward at first, but I grew to love the freedom it afforded me and I was able to make ends meet!\n\n// FirstBank\n// I ended up taking an assistant supervisor position in the treasury management department at FirstBank. I was\n// responsible for a team of nine employees that focused on phone based customer service and account management\n// to our treasury management customers. I was responsible for interviewing and hiring new members on my team as well as\n// creating training plans and having one on ones to review performance and discuss career goals .I worked there for just\n// over a year right when COVID hit. During this time, I decided that I wanted to change my career path and committed to\n// attending Turing School of Software & Design.\n\n// Turing\n// I've been thinking about coding for the better part of three years. I tried random tutorials online but never really\n// committed to it. But with Turing, I decided to fully commit to coding and the career change. I chose the Front-End\n// Engineering program. This is a seven month, full-time coding bootcamp. On average, I'd spend 65+ hours a week attending\n// class, taking notes, practicing problem solving, and working on the constantly changing projects with evolving\n// languages. It's been the hardest thing I've ever done but so far has been the most rewarding journey I've taken. I've\n// met some great people in my cohort and have a positive and excited outlook for my future.\n","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/rancid.9103968c.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/gamesleuth.7980d8ec.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/prague.15b71889.jpg\";","import React, { useState } from \"react\";\nimport \"./Portfolio.scss\";\nimport { Zoom } from \"react-slideshow-image\";\n\nimport rancid from \"../../assets/rancid.png\";\nimport gamesleuth from \"../../assets/gamesleuth.png\";\nimport prague from \"../../assets/prague.jpg\";\n\nconst Portfolio = () => {\n  const [load, setLoad] = useState(false);\n\n  // const images = [gamesleuth, rancid, prague];\n\n  const zoomInProperties = {\n    indicators: true,\n    scale: 1.4,\n  };\n\n  //animation for portfolio, then setLoad to generate slideshow\n\n  return (\n    <div className=\"portfolio-container\">\n      <Zoom {...zoomInProperties}>\n      <div key={0} className=\"slide-div\">\n        <h1 className=\"portfolio-title\">Game Sleuth</h1>\n        <img className=\"slide-img\" src={gamesleuth} alt=\"Game Sleuth\" />\n      </div>\n      <div key={1} className=\"slide-div\">\n        <h1 className=\"portfolio-title\">Rancid Tomatillos</h1>\n        <img className=\"slide-img\" src={rancid} alt=\"Rancid Tomatillos\" />\n      </div>\n      <div key={2} className=\"slide-div\">\n        <h1 className=\"portfolio-title\">Project 3</h1>\n        <img className=\"slide-img\" src={prague} alt=\"Portfolio\" />\n      </div>\n      </Zoom>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default Portfolio;\n","import React from \"react\";\n\nconst Interests = () => {\n  return <h1>Interests</h1>;\n};\n\nexport default Interests;\n\n//baking\n//lifting\n//miami dolphins\n//lotr / harry potter\n//gaming\n//festivals\n//grilling / smoking \n//space\n//ai -> how will it shape society when most things are automated\n//snowboarding","import React from \"react\";\n\nconst Contact = () => {\n  return <h1>Contact</h1>;\n};\n\nexport default Contact;\n//linkedin\n//github\n//twitter\n//email\n//phone ","import './App.scss';\nimport WelcomePage from '../WelcomePage';\nimport Nav from '../Nav';\nimport Career from '../Career';\nimport Portfolio from '../Portfolio';\nimport Interests from '../Interests';\nimport Contact from '../Contact';\nimport { Route, Switch} from 'react-router-dom';\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Nav />\n      <h1>⚠️⚠️SITE UNDER CONSTRUCTION⚠️⚠️</h1>\n\n      <Switch>\n        <Route exact path='/' component={WelcomePage} />\n        <Route exact path='/personal-site' component={WelcomePage} />\n        <Route exact path='/about' component={Career} />\n        <Route exact path='/portfolio' component={Portfolio} />\n        <Route exact path='/interests' component={Interests} />\n        <Route exact path='/contact' component={Contact} />\n      </Switch>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","import React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport './index.scss';\nimport App from './Components/App';\nimport { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <BrowserRouter>\n    <App />\n  </BrowserRouter>,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n\n\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
